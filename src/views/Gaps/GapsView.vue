          The purpose of step one is <span className="font-bold">1_</span> that give you an idea
          about what people really care about. We need to <span className="font-bold">2_</span> with
          their situation. For example, if you want to help old people, you might find that they
          want to keep the ability to walk around. In your <span className="font-bold">3_</span>,
          they might share with you different ways they can do that. Later in the
          <span className="font-bold">4_</span> you&apos;ll want to dig a little deeper, look for
          personal stories or situations where things became <span className="font-bold">5_</span>.
          Ideally, you redo the process with many people with the same problem.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Looking at the interviews, you can now understand the actual needs that people are trying
          to
          <span className="font-bold">1_</span> with certain activities. One way to do that is to
          <span className="font-bold">2_</span> the verbs or activities that the people mentioned
          when talking about their problems: like going for a walk, meeting old friends for tea, or
          simply going <span className="font-bold">3_</span> around the corner store. You might
          realize it&apos;s not so much about going out, but more about staying in touch. After your
          <span className="font-bold">4_</span>, formulate a problem statement: &quot;Some elderly
          are afraid to be <span className="font-bold">5_</span>. The want to stay connected.&quot;

        <p className="mb-4">
          Now focus only on the <span className="font-bold">1_</span> and come up with ideas that
          solve the problem. The point is not to get a perfect idea, but rather
          <span className="font-bold">2_</span> with as many ideas: like
          <span className="font-bold">3_</span> virtual reality experiences, senior friendly
          <span className="font-bold">4_</span> or a modified <span className="font-bold">5_</span>.
          Whatever it is, sketch up your best ideas and show them to the people you are trying to
          help, so you get their feedback.

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-4">STEP 4: PROTOTYPE</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Now take a moment <span className="font-bold">1_</span> on what you have learned from your
          conversations about the different ideas. Ask yourself, how does your idea fit in the
          context of people&apos;s actual lives. Your <span className="font-bold">2_</span> could be
          a <span className="font-bold">3_</span> of a new idea and what is already being used. Then
          connect the <span className="font-bold">4_</span>,
          <span className="font-bold">5_</span> your final solution and go build a real prototype
          that&apos;s just good enough to be tested.

        <h3 className="font-bold mb-4">STEP 5: TEST</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Now test your <span className="font-bold">1_</span> with actual users. Don&apos;t defend
          your idea in case people don&apos;t like it, the point is to learn what works and what
          didn&apos;t, so any <span className="font-bold">2_</span> is great. Then go back to
          <span className="font-bold">3_</span> or prototyping and
          <span className="font-bold">4_</span> your learning. Repeat the process until you have a
          prototype that works and <span className="font-bold">5_</span> the real problem. Now you
          are ready to change the world or open shop.
